  PacificSource Health Plans is on a successful multi-year journey to migrate our data and analytics ecosystem to the Databricks Lakehouse.
  A significant challenge was migrating a critical reporting data mart reliant on extensive legacy SAS code with sophisticated business logic for membership, claims, premiums, and reserves.
  This session explores the unique challenges faced in migrating this legacy SAS code, how our partner (T1A) used automation (Alchemist) to reverse engineer, translate, and validate the code, and the key lessons learned from this complex migration effort.
